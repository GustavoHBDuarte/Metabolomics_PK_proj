# Rosuvastatin Absorption Estimator - Predicting AUC and Cmax: Project Overview

Rosuvastatin is a quite known lipid-lowering agent generally used for hypercholesterolemia treatment and coronary artery diseases prevention. There is a substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of statins, which in turn may affect drug therapy safety and efficacy. Therefore, the ability of predicting the individual absorption of Rosuvastin before even taking the drug would be tremendously valuable for optimal drug therapy, minimizing adverse effects.This project basically aims to:

* Develop an algorithm that can predict to predict interindividual Rosuvastatin absorption by predicting the main pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and Cmax. 
* Optimize Elastic Net regression applying feature selection and GridSearchCV hyperparameters tuning.
* Validate the model by means of Leave-One-Out cross validation
