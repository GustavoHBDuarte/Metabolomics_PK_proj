# Rosuvastatin Absorption Estimator - Predicting AUC and Cmax: Project Overview

Rosuvastatin is a quite known lipid-lowering agent generally used for hypercholesterolemia treatment and coronary artery diseases prevention. There is a substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of statins usually caused by genetic polymorphisms leading to variation in the corresponding pharmacokinetics parameters, which may affect drug therapy safety and efficacy.
